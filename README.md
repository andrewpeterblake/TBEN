## TBEN

Repository for code for TBEN R event. 

Includes the presentation, "R (and RStudio) for Econometricians.pdf".

The two examples are: 

- The first is wrangling the McCracken and Ng FRED monthly database of 127 series 
(MultipleMultiple2.r), then doing ADF tests on each and fitting AR(2) models.
- The second is an IV estimator solution to the biased estimates obtained using OLS when there is a collider 
present (CollideA.r) and draws DAGs of the problem.

An earlier [recording from 17 May 2022](https://vimeo.com/714018017/1879a82119) for a different event has more 
detail on both of these examples, which you may find useful. 
The [IV/DAG example begins at 0h:9m:25s](https://vimeo.com/714018017/1879a82119?ts=565000) and the 
[FRED data example begins at 1h:14m:44s](https://vimeo.com/714018017/1879a82119?ts=4480000). Depending on how you access GitHub 
this may play at exactly the right point, or you may have to find the right timed entry point. On an iPhone it doesn't!
